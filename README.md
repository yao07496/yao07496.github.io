This is a personal website project.

Consists of Home page(index.html), Projects(projects.html), fun stuff(fun.html), and resume(resume.html).
I feel I have acomplished the following: 
- Css files to support common theme for the entire website.
- Css and images have their own folder.
- Using relative paths for images and links.
- Used ALT for images.
- Used scalable units.
- Links to other pages on the site open in new tab while contents in own site stays in current tab.
- Made website responsive. 
- Included media images and links to videos.
- Can naviagate through four different pages.
